# Shortest Path Game: Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon

Welcome to the Shortest Path Game! This game is inspired by the concept of "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon," where players try to connect any actor to Kevin Bacon through their film roles in the shortest number of steps. In our version, we use Python and Pandas to create a similar game that lets you find the shortest path between any two entities in a dataset.

## Features
- Find the shortest path between two entities using graph traversal algorithms.
- Use Pandas to handle and manipulate large datasets.
- Interactive command-line interface for playing the game.
- Easily extensible to various datasets beyond actors and movies.
